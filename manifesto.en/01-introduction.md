# Introduction

*Windows Devs* is an open initiative aimed at transforming Windows into an operating system designed from the ground up for developers. It’s not a distribution, a tool, or a specific configuration—it’s a conceptual proposal that defines how a reproducible, transparent, and user-respecting development environment should be structured on Windows.

This idea originates from **MasBytes SV**, driven by a technical and pedagogical concern: why do so many developers face friction, ambiguity, and inconsistent environments when working on Windows? What if we designed an experience that prioritizes explicit architecture, clarity, and reproducibility?

This manifesto is the first step. It outlines the principles, problems, and proposals that shape *Windows Devs*. It’s not a closed document—it’s an invitation to think, build, and collaborate.
