# Windows Devs  
*The operating system developers deserve.*

📄 This manifesto is also available in [Español](README.md)

## 🧭 Introduction

For years, developers have had to adapt their workflows to operating systems that weren’t designed with them in mind. Setting up environments, managing profiles, simulating production, optimizing resources… all of it takes time, effort, and experience. And while Microsoft has made important strides toward the developer community, a stigma still lingers: that Windows isn’t for developers.

**Windows Devs** was born to change that. It’s a vision of an operating system designed from the ground up for those who build software. Not just an environment —a living, conscious, and collaborative platform.

## ❌ Problems it solves

- Friction in configuring Dev/Test/Prod environments
- Lack of local production simulation
- Uncontrolled resource consumption (RAM, CPU, disk)
- Absence of integrated tools for QA, DevOps, and architecture
- The cultural stigma of Windows vs. Linux in the dev world

## 🧩 Key components

### 🔧 Smart profiles
Automatic management of `dev`, `test`, and `prod` environments, including variables, ports, services, and resource allocation.

### 🧭 VS Code as a browser
Web navigation inside VS Code with inspection, component extraction, and project generation from real pages.

### 🧠 Specialized Copilot
Roles like `Senior Copilot`, `QA Copilot`, and `DevOps Copilot` for refactoring, test generation, architecture analysis, and more.

### 🧪 Production simulation
Embedded servers + virtual machines to replicate real-world environments without leaving the OS.

### ⚙️ Intelligent resource management
Isolation and prioritization of critical processes to avoid bottlenecks and ensure smooth testing and deployment.

### 🛒 Marketplace and extensions
Extensions for profiles, dashboards, testing tools, and more —fully integrated and versioned.

## 💰 Business model

- Tiered licensing (Home, Standard, DevOps)
- Extension marketplace with revenue sharing
- Azure integration for real deployments
- Copilot roles as premium services
- Official certifications and training

## 📈 Expected impact

- Increased productivity and software quality
- Fewer errors and faster delivery
- Democratization of professional-grade development
- Cultural reconciliation between Windows and the dev community

## 🤝 Call to action

We invite Microsoft, the developer community, and technical leaders to help build the future of development.  
**Windows Devs is not just an idea —it’s a necessity.**

## 🛠️ **This project is under active development**

The manifesto is just the beginning. *Windows Devs* is a growing initiative: we’ll continue expanding this repository with ideas, technical proposals, reproducible examples, and tools that reflect our vision.
